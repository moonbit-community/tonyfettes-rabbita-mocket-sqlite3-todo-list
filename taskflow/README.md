# TaskFlow

A full-stack team task management app built with MoonBit demonstrating isomorphic code sharing between frontend and backend. The shared package contains status transition rules, validation, priority sorting, deadline detection, and domain types used by both targets.

## Quick Start

```bash
make serve    # Build & run on http://localhost:4006
```

## Features

- **Tasks**: Create, edit, delete tasks with title, description, priority, assignee, and due date
- **Status workflow**: Tasks follow a defined state machine (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done), with blocking/unblocking support
- **Isomorphic status transitions**: Transition rules defined once in shared code, enforced on both client and server
- **Team members**: Pre-seeded team (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Eve) with colored avatars
- **Priority sorting**: Tasks sorted by priority (Urgent → High → Medium → Low), then by due date
- **Deadline tracking**: Overdue detection and urgency labels (Overdue, Due today, Upcoming)
- **Text search**: Case-insensitive search across task titles and descriptions
- **Filters**: Filter by status, priority, and assignee — combinable with search
- **Kanban board view**: Toggle between list and board views — board groups tasks in status columns
- **Activity tracking**: Status changes logged with timestamps, shown in activity feed
- **Progress tracking**: Completion percentage and per-status task counts
- **Delete confirmation**: Modal dialog prevents accidental task deletion
- **Error notifications**: Toast notifications for failed server requests
- **Validation**: Shared limits and proper YYYY-MM-DD date format checking

## Isomorphic Design

The `shared/` package compiles to both JS and native targets, providing:

| Shared Code | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `types.mbt` | `Task`, `Member`, `Board` structs with JSON derive |
| `status.mbt` | Status transitions (`allowed_transitions`, `is_valid_transition`, `transition_label`) |
| `logic.mbt` | Priority sorting, deadline detection, progress tracking, filtering |
| `validation.mbt` | Input validation (`validate_task_title`, `validate_status`, limits) |
| `routes.mbt` | API path constants and builders |

The status transition state machine is the key isomorphic feature — the frontend renders only valid transition buttons, and the backend enforces the same rules:

```
todo ──→ in_progress ──→ review ──→ done
  ↕           ↕             ↓         ↓
blocked ←───────────       ←──      todo (reopen)
```

## API

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/board` | Full board (tasks + members + today's date) |
| GET | `/api/members` | List all team members |
| POST | `/api/tasks` | Create task `{"title": "...", "priority": "...", "assignee_id": N, "due_date": "..."}` |
| GET | `/api/tasks/:id` | Get a single task |
| POST | `/api/tasks/:id` | Update task fields |
| POST | `/api/tasks/:id/status` | Change status `{"status": "..."}` (validates transition) |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/:id` | Delete task |
